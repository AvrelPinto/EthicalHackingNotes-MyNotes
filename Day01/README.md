### **3. Types of Cyber Threats**

| Type                  | Description                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Malware**           | Malicious software like viruses, worms, Trojans.                                   |
| **Phishing**          | Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive info by pretending to be a trusted entity. |
| **Ransomware**        | Encrypts data and demands ransom for decryption.                                   |
| **Man-in-the-Middle** | Intercepts communication between two parties.                                      |
| **Denial-of-Service** | Overwhelms systems/networks to make them unavailable.                              |
| **Zero-Day Exploits** | Attacks on unknown software vulnerabilities.                                       |

### **4. Key Concepts in Cybersecurity**

* **CIA Triad:**

  * **Confidentiality:** Ensuring only authorized individuals access information.
  * **Integrity:** Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered.
  * **Availability:** Ensuring reliable access to information and systems.

* **Authentication & Authorization:**

  * **Authentication** confirms identity (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
  * **Authorization** grants access rights after authentication.

* **Firewalls & Antivirus:**

  * Tools used to monitor, detect, and prevent threats.

### **5. Cybersecurity Domains**

* **Network Security:** Protects internal networks from intruders.
* **Application Security:** Secures software from threats.
* **Endpoint Security:** Secures devices like computers and mobiles.
* **Cloud Security:** Secures cloud-based platforms and data.
* **Information Security:** Protects data integrity and privacy.
* **Operational Security (OpSec):** Protects operations and processes.
* **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity:** Plans to recover from incidents.
